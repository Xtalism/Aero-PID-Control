# Aero PID Control

PID controller using two brushless motors with its respective ESC, and an Arduino Mega 2560.

The structure was created using SolidWorks 3D modeling software. We didn't make any mechanical simulation because I thought it was no necessary.

The plot I did has the function to compare my error with my variable of control (PID output) and the actual setpoint I wanted to reach, which was a great success all allong.
